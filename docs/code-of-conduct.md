# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for professional behavior and shared values for all members of the CDR Forecasting Stack project. These expectations apply to **everyone** involved in the project, without exception, including Principal Investigators, Postdoctoral Scientists, students, collaborators, and etc. This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related spaces and activities, including meetings, workshops, conferences, fieldwork, online platforms (e.g. Slack, GitHub, email), and social events associated with the project. Nothing in this Code of Conduct replaces or supersedes applicable university policies.

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to foster a safe, inclusive, respectful, and productive working environment. High-quality research can only be conducted when all participants feel supported and treated with dignity. 

## Core Principles

We are committed to:

- Mutual respect and professionalism
- Open communication and collaboration
- Transparent, reproducible, and open research

## Expected Behavior

All participants are expected to:

- Treat colleagues with respect in all interactions, communications, and actions.
- Learn and use colleagues’ names and correct pronunciations.
- Respect others’ working hours, availability, and response times. While tools such as Slack or email enable rapid communication, it should not be assumed that recipients are immediately available.
- Be mindful of power dynamics. Suggestions, feedback, or requests from supervisors or senior collaborators may be perceived as directives by junior team members, even when not intended that way. Because supervisors and senior collaborators influence evaluations, funding, and authorship, their words and actions may carry more weight than intended. Those in positions of authority should take extra care to foster open discussion and to make it safe to disagree.
- Use appropriate judgment when choosing communication channels, especially for sensitive or complex matters.
- Communicate openly and clearly to avoid misunderstandings and inadvertent exclusion.
- Assume good faith in interactions and encourage addressing misunderstandings early and constructively whenever possible.
- Contribute constructively in meetings by listening actively, inviting input, and avoiding side conversations that may be distracting or exclusionary.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Racism, sexism, ableism, or other forms of discrimination
- Hate speech, harassment, threats, or intimidation
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Personal attacks, bullying, or sustained disruptive behavior
- Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith

## Reporting and Response

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to take one of the following steps:

- Report the concern directly to a Principal Investigator (Elizabeth, Luke, or Noah).
- Ask a trusted team member to report the concern on your behalf.

Reports will be handled with discretion and care. Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith will not be tolerated.
