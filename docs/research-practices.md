# Research Practices

The CDR Forecasting Stack project is committed to responsible, transparent, and reproducible research. The following practices guide research conduct, authorship, publication, and software development across the project.

## Authorship and Contributions

- Authorship will follow the [Vancouver Convention](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).
- Author contributions will be described using the [CRediT taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/).
- Authorship and contribution decisions should be discussed openly and revisited as projects evolve.

## Transparency, Reproducibility, and Open Research

- Transparency and reproducibility are core requirements of the research and publication process.
- Whenever possible, publications should be made openly available, either through open-access journals or institutional or disciplinary repositories (e.g., [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or [Earth ArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/)).
- Data supporting publications should be made openly available whenever feasible. When full data release is not possible, reduced or derived datasets sufficient to support published results should be shared.

## Software, Data, and Licensing

- Code developed specifically within the CDR Forecasting Stack project should be hosted under the CDR Forecasting Stack GitHub organization.
- Software developed in collaboration with, but not exclusively for, the project should be open source and accessible without authentication or fee barriers.
- Private repositories may be used during active development.
- Licensing decisions remain with the original authors but should be consistent with host institution policies and adhere to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) or the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd).
- Recommended licenses include MIT for software and Creative Commons CC-BY for non-code products such as text, figures, and websites.
